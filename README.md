# WGU_Score_Reports
Because WGU does not evaluate GPA, this repository holds my respective score reports for each class.

For WGU classes that end in an Objective Assessment, I have provided the name of the course and included a screenshot of the score report that is provided by WGU.
    The black bar on the scale represents the base requirement for "Competent," which WGU recognizes as "at least 3.0."
    Classes well above competent or exemplary are arguably higher than 3.0.

For WGU classes that ended with a CompTIA Exam (i.e. 220-1001), I have provided the course number and CompTIA score report details.

For all other transcripts with Grades ending in a GPA, copies are available at SLU (Saint Louis University).

For pre-calculus competency, EdReady competency path reports are available.
